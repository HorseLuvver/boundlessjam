list of bugs/problems
music switch doesnt really work well(waterfall always plays regardless)
----------------------------------------------
The tutorial breaks the game against walrus
----------------------------------------------
I can make a win screen
----------------------------------------------
potions are too rare

Really easy things 
set up seal/wolf spawners
----------------------------------------------
display damage, health and exp
----------------------------------------------
moving water
----------------------------------------------
add walking sound effects

Completely optional things
look back at the weapon system idea
----------------------------------------------
add different drops/items(bombs, shields, repellent, etc)

Kind of complicated things 
assign formulaic speed stats to animals(jab is fast, pounce is slow, claw and bite are average)
----------------------------------------------
assign formulaic defense stats to animals(pounce is bulky, jab is frail, claw and bite are average)
----------------------------------------------
give animals stat scaling (higher letter count = higher stats)

Really Important
give the walrus battle stages
----------------------------------------------
give the game more direction (different biomes have different scenes, maybe more linear gameplay)
----------------------------------------------
I should design mini bosses for each biome
